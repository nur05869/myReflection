## Personal Reflection

As a computer science major, working on these projects has been an incredibly enriching experience. Each project has provided unique insights and challenges, contributing to my growth as a developer:

1. **webdev-dynamic**: This project has deepened my understanding of server-side scripting and database management. Building a dynamic server capable of handling traffic violation data has enhanced my skills in JavaScript, Node.js, and SQLite. It reinforced the importance of RESTful API design and efficient data management, preparing me for real-world web development scenarios.

2. **webdev-rest**: Developing a RESTful API from scratch was a significant milestone. It taught me the intricacies of creating scalable and maintainable web services. Handling HTTP requests and responses, setting up middleware, and ensuring data consistency were invaluable lessons that I will carry forward in my career.

3. **nur05869.github.io**: Creating a personal website allowed me to explore front-end development and user experience design. It was a creative outlet to showcase my projects and professional information, blending technical skills with design principles.

These projects collectively have broadened my perspective on full-stack development. They have provided me with a solid foundation in both back-end and front-end technologies, making me a more versatile and confident developer. I look forward to applying these skills in future projects and continuing to grow in the field of computer science.

# webdev-dynamic

## Description

This repository contains a dynamic web development project utilizing JavaScript, Node.js, and SQLite. The project is designed to handle and manage data related to traffic violations and bad drivers through a dynamically generated server. It demonstrates the practical application of RESTful services, focusing on how to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on a database through a web interface. The project highlights key aspects of server-side scripting and database management, providing a comprehensive learning experience for web development students.

### Domain-Specific Perspective: Traffic Violation Data Management

In the context of traffic violation data management, this project simulates a system that municipalities or transportation agencies might use to keep track of driving infractions. By creating a RESTful API, it provides a standardized way to interact with the traffic violation data, ensuring data integrity and ease of access.

The system allows for the following operations:
- **Create**: Adding new traffic violation records to the database.
- **Read**: Retrieving details of existing violations, either all at once or by specific criteria.
- **Update**: Modifying details of existing traffic violation records.
- **Delete**: Removing outdated or incorrect records from the database.

This dynamic approach ensures that data is always current and can be easily modified or retrieved by authorized users, which is critical for effective traffic management and legal enforcement.
